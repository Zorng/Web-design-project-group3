    <p>All rights and license grants to Users shall immediately terminate upon any termination or expiration of the Agreement.</p>
    <h3 id="api-usage-terms">API usage terms</h3>
    <p>Users may access their data relating to Coolors via the Application Program Interface (API). Any use of the API, including use of the API through a third-party product/service that accesses Coolors, is bound by these Terms and, in addition, by the following specific terms:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>the User expressly understands and agrees that the Owner bears no responsibility and shall not be held liable for any damages or losses resulting from the User’s use of the API or their use of any third-party products/services that access data through the API.</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h2 id="terms-and-conditions-of-sale">TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE</h2><h3 id="paid-products">Paid Products</h3>
    <p>Some of the Products provided on Coolors, as part of the Service, are provided on the basis of payment.</p>
    
    <p>The fees, duration and conditions applicable to the purchase of such Products are described below and in the dedicated sections of Coolors.</p>
    <p>To purchase Products, the User must register or log into Coolors.</p>
    <h3 id="product-description">Product description</h3>
    <p>Prices, descriptions or availability of Products are outlined in the respective sections of Coolors and are subject to change without notice.</p>
    
    <p>While Products on Coolors are presented with the greatest accuracy technically possible, representation on Coolors through any means (including, as the case may be, graphic material, images, colors, sounds) is for reference only and implies no warranty as to the characteristics of the purchased Product.</p>
    
    <p>The characteristics of the chosen Product will be outlined during the purchasing process.</p>
    <h3 id="purchasing-process">Purchasing process</h3>
    <p>Any steps taken from choosing a Product to order submission form part of the purchasing process.</p>
    
    <p>The purchasing process includes these steps:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Users must choose the desired Product and verify their purchase selection.</li>
    <li>After having reviewed the information displayed in the purchase selection, Users may place the order by submitting it.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 id="order-submission">Order submission</h3>
    <p>When the User submits an order, the following applies:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for the User the obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the order page.</li>
    <li>In case the purchased Product requires an action from the User, such as the provision of personal information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation for the User to cooperate accordingly.</li>
    <li>Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt confirming that the order has been received.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be sent to the email address provided by the User for such purposes.</p>
    <h3 id="prices">Prices</h3>
    <p>Users are informed during the purchasing process and before order submission, about any fees, taxes and costs (including, if any, delivery costs) that they will be charged.</p>
    
    <p>Prices on Coolors are displayed:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>either exclusive or inclusive of any applicable fees, taxes and costs, depending on the section the User is browsing.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 id="methods-of-payment">Methods of payment</h3>
    <p>Information related to accepted payment methods are made available during the purchasing process.</p>
    
    <p>Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional conditions or fees. In such cases related information can be found in the dedicated section of Coolors.</p>
    <p>All payments are independently processed through third-party services. Therefore, Coolors does not collect any payment information – such as credit card details – but only receives a notification once the payment has been successfully completed.</p>
    
    <p>If a payment through the available methods fails or is refused by the payment service provider, the Owner shall be under no obligation to fulfill the purchase order. If a payment fails or is refused, the Owner reserves the right to claim any related expenses or damages from the User.</p>
    <h3 id="authorization-for-future-paypal-payment">Authorization for future PayPal payment</h3>
    <p>If Users authorize the PayPal feature which allows future purchases, Coolors will store an identification code linked to the Users’ PayPal account. This will authorize Coolors to automatically process payments for future purchases or recurring installments of past purchases.</p>
    
    <p>This authorization can be revoked at any time, either by contacting the Owner or by changing the user settings offered by PayPal.</p>
    <h3 id="purchase-via-app-store">Purchase via app store</h3>
    <p>Coolors or specific Products available for sale on Coolors must be purchased via a third-party app store. To access such purchases, Users must follow the instructions provided on the relevant online store (such as "Apple App Store" or "Google Play"), which may vary depending on the particular device in use.</p>
    
    <p>Unless otherwise specified, purchases done via third-party online stores are also subject to such third-parties’ terms and conditions, which, in case of any inconsistency or conflict, shall always prevail upon these Terms.</p>
    
    <p>Users purchasing through such third-party online stores must therefore read such terms and conditions of sale carefully and accept them.</p>
    <h3 id="retention-of-usage-rights">Retention of usage rights</h3>
    <p>Users do not acquire any rights to use the purchased Product until the total purchase price is received by the Owner.</p>
    <h3 id="delivery">Delivery</h3><h4 id="performance-of-services">Performance of services</h4>
    <p>The purchased service shall be performed or made available within the timeframe specified on Coolors or as communicated before the order submission.</p>
    <h3 id="contract-duration">Contract duration</h3><h4 id="subscriptions">Subscriptions</h4>
    <p>Subscriptions allow Users to receive a Product continuously or regularly over time. Details regarding the type of subscription and termination are outlined below.</p>
    <h4 id="fixed-term-subscriptions">Fixed-term subscriptions</h4>
    <p>Paid fixed-term subscriptions start on the day the payment is received by the Owner and last for the subscription period chosen by the User or otherwise specified during the purchasing process.</p>
    
    <p>Once the subscription period expires, the Product shall no longer be accessible.</p>
    <h4 id="subscriptions-handled-via-apple-id">Subscriptions handled via Apple ID</h4>
    <p>Users may subscribe to a Product using the Apple ID associated with their Apple App Store account by using the relevant process on Coolors. When doing so, Users acknowledge and accept that</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>any payment due shall be charged to their Apple ID account;</li>
    <li>subscriptions are automatically renewed for the same duration unless the User cancels at least 24 hours before the current period expires;</li>
    <li>any and all fees or payments due for renewal will be charged within 24-hours before the end of the current period;</li>
    <li>subscriptions can be managed or cancelled in the Users’ Apple App Store account settings.</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <p>The above shall prevail upon any conflicting or diverging provision of these Terms.</p>
    <h4 id="automatic-renewal-of-fixed-term-subscriptions">Automatic renewal of fixed-term subscriptions</h4>
    <p><strong>Subscriptions are automatically renewed through the payment method that the User chose during purchase.</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>The renewed subscription will last for a period equal to the original term.</strong></p>
    <p>The User shall receive a reminder of the upcoming renewal with reasonable advance, outlining the procedure to be followed in order to cancel the automatic renewal.</p>
    <h5 id="termination">Termination</h5>
    <p><strong>Subscriptions may be terminated by sending a clear and unambiguous termination notice to the Owner using the contact details provided in this document, or — if applicable — by using the corresponding controls inside Coolors.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>If the notice of termination is received by the Owner before the subscription renews, the termination shall take effect as soon as the current period is completed.</strong></p>
    <h4 id="exception-for-consumers">Exception for Consumers</h4>
    <p>However, regardless of the above, if the User qualifies as a Consumer, the following applies:</p>
    
    <p><strong>At the end of the initial term, subscriptions are automatically extended for an unlimited period, unless the User terminates before the end of such term.</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>The fee due upon extension will be charged on the payment method that the User chose during purchase.</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>After extension, the subscription will last for an indefinite period and may be terminated monthly.</strong></p>
    <p>The User shall receive a reminder of the upcoming unlimited extension with reasonable advance, outlining the procedure to be followed in order to prevent the extension or terminate the subscription thereafter.</p>
    <h5 id="termination">Termination</h5>
    <p><strong>Extended subscriptions may be terminated at any time by sending a clear and unambiguous termination notice to the Owner using the contact details provided in this document, or — if applicable — by using the corresponding controls inside Coolors.</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>If the notice of termination is received by the Owner by the end of the current month, the subscription shall expire at the end of such month.</strong></p>
    
    <h2 id="user-rights">User rights</h2><h3 id="right-of-withdrawal">Right of withdrawal</h3>
    <p>Unless exceptions apply, the User may be eligible to withdraw from the contract within the period specified below (generally 14 days), for any reason and without justification. Users can learn more about the withdrawal conditions within this section.</p>
    <h4 id="the-right-of-withdrawal-does-not-apply-on-this_application">The right of withdrawal does not apply on Coolors</h4>
    <p>Users acknowledge and accept that the right of withdrawal does not apply to contracts concluded over Coolors due to the nature of its offering.</p>
    
    
    <h2 id="liability-and-indemnification">Liability and indemnification</h2><h4 id="indemnification">Indemnification</h4>
    <p>The User agrees to indemnify and hold the Owner and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners and employees harmless from and against any claim or demand ⁠— including but not limited to lawyer's fees and costs ⁠— made by any third party due to or in relation with any culpable use of or connection to the Service, violation of these Terms, infringement of any third-party rights or statutory provision by the User or its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners and employees to the extent allowed by applicable law.</p>
    <h4 id="limitation-of-liability">Limitation of liability</h4>
    <p>Unless otherwise explicitly stated and without prejudice to applicable statutory product liability provisions, Users shall have no right to claim damages against the Owner (or any natural or legal person acting on its behalf).</p>
    
    <p>This does not apply to damages to life, health or physical integrity, damages resulting from the breach of an essential contractual obligation such as any obligation strictly necessary to achieve the purpose of the contract, and/or damages resulting from intent or gross negligence, as long as Coolors has been appropriately and correctly used by the User.</p>
    
    <p>Unless damages have been caused by way of intent or gross negligence, or they affect life, health or physical integrity, the Owner shall only be liable to the extent of typical and foreseeable damages at the moment the contract was entered into.</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding the above, the following limitation applies to all Users not qualifying as Consumers:</p>
    <p>In any event of liability, the compensation may not exceed the total payments that have been, will be or would be received by the Owner from the User based on the contract over a period of 12 months, or the period of the duration of the Agreement, if shorter.</p>
    <h3 id="australian-users">Australian Users</h3><h4 id="limitation-of-liability">Limitation of liability</h4>
    <p>Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts or modifies any guarantee, condition, warranty, right or remedy which the User may have under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) or any similar State and Territory legislation and which cannot be excluded, restricted or modified (non-excludable right). To the fullest extent permitted by law, our liability to the User, including liability for a breach of a non-excludable right and liability which is not otherwise excluded under these Terms of Use, is limited, at the Owner’s sole discretion, to the re-performance of the services or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.</p>
